It's a rust 3D math library that I made while I was reading the book "Foundations of Engine Development: Mathematics" by Eric Lengyel, the 3D math library is contained in the "math" module.

The main.rs file uses the 3D math library to implement a small rasterizer, it can draw a triangle by calling the "draw_triangle" function instead of the draw_obj_file in line 68 of the file.

I don't think I'll finish the book, but I think it was a good introduction of the basics of linear algebra.
